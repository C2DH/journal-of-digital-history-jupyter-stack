# Journal of Digital History Jupyter Stack

Journal of Digital History Jupyter Stack is a set of ready-to-run [Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/c2dhunilu/journal-of-digital-history-jupyter) containing specific version of Jupyter notebook along with the extensions needed to write and publish article for the [Journal of digital history](https://journalofdigitalhistory.org/).

You can use the docker image to:

- start a personal Jupyter Notebook server on your local machine;
- connect your [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) library to cite2c extension to integrate your references in your notebooks;
- test your local notebook using the the [local notebook viewer](https://journalofdigitalhistory.org/en/local-notebook) of the Journal of Digital History.

## Quick Start

If you want to run it locally (or in your own server), first you need to install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). The latter is recommended to speed up the installation process.

**NOTE** For Windows OS, see our step-by-step guide [pdf format](https://github.com/C2DH/journal-of-digital-history-jupyter-stack/blob/master/docker-desktop-windows.pdf)

Clone the project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/C2DH/journal-of-digital-history-jupyter-stack.git
```

Then open a terminal and run the command below at the root of the directory `journal-of-digital-history-jupyter-stack`

```bash
docker-compose up
```

The `docker-compose up` command pulls the latest [c2dhunilu/journal-of-digital-history-jupyter](https://hub.docker.com/r/c2dhunilu/journal-of-digital-history-jupyter) image if it is not already present on your local machine.
It then starts a container running a Jupyter Server and exposes the container's internal port `8888` to port `8889` of the host machine.

Open [http://localhost:8889](http://localhost:8889)` in a browser to get your Jupyter Notebook ready.

You will be asked for a `token` that you can find on the terminal console:

Once Jupyter Notebook has started, visit the page `Nbextensions`, uncheck the option **disable configuration for nbextensions without explicit compatibility (they may break your notebook environment, but can be useful to show for nbextension development)** to enable the installed extensions.
In this docker image we have included:

- the [cite2c](https://github.com/takluyver/cite2c) extension to integrate Zotero and use bibliographic references in your notebooks;
- the table of contents extension;
- the code prettify extension.

Visit the Journal of Digital History [guidelines](https://journalofdigitalhistory.org/en/guidelines) to understand the correct procedure to write compatible articles from your notebooks.

Enjoy!
  
## Developing and building local images

The official image will work for 90% of the use cases but if like to modify our official Dockerfile to fit your specific needs you will need to build your images in your machine.
We have a local docker-compose file to speed up the development:
 
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```
